<p>About Me</p>
<p>Elizabeth Muise is a visual artist and a dancer. She has been dancing for eighteen years, and bellydancing for seven of those years. She looks forward to sharing this beautiful art form with you! Check out her artwork at <a href="www.redmuise.com">www.redmuise.com</a></p>
<p>Open Level Bellydance Workshop with Elizabeth Muise</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dancing the Ecstatic</p>
<p>In this workshop we will be covering basic middle eastern dance movements.  Through bellydance, we will </p>
<p>internalize sacred symbols such as the circle and the figure eight (infinity), embody the elements, and roll through all of the chakras of the body. </p>
<p>Bellydance naturally opens a channel from the earth through our bodies to the divine. </p>
<p>Join me as we connect to the earth, our bodies, our inner selves, to each other, and the sacred through the power of this beautiful art and ancient dance.<br />

<p class="style85"><img src="lilith dorsey" alt="brid's closet-lilith dorsey" /></p>
<p class="style85">Magickal Oils, Waters, and Baths of Voodoo and Santeria
This course will provide a hands on session diving into the magickal world of Voodoo and Santeria. We will discuss the origins of these religions and how people can honor these Lwa/Orisha/Deities in their daily lives. One of the most important ways of doing magick in these traditions is the creation of sacred oil, water, and bath formulas. This class will provide recipes, formulas as well as giving everyone a chance to create some of their own preparations. $5 fee required.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="style85">Class description:</p>
<p class="style85"> Women who walk a Warrior's Path: 
  The path of the Warrior is one steeped in misinterpretation and misrepresentation. It is a path that often is not popular, is sometimes lonely and demands a courageous spirit. The focus of this workshop is how women approach and walk the Warrior's Path. Exploring the inner warrior in every woman; the things women fight for, the reclaiming of the Clan Mothers, and the Warrior Aspect of the Goddess. This workshop is for every woman who has ever defended her hearth and family, to every woman who has honorably stood her ground on what she knew in her heart and gut to be right.

            <p class="style79"><img src="Brid's Closet Janet Farrar and Gavin Bone" alt="Brid's Closet-Janet Farrar and Gavin Bone" width="232" height="341" />Janet Farrar and Gavin Bone will be facilitating our ritual this year. They will also be taking appointments for tarot readings (Janet) and spiritual healings (Gavin) </p>
            <p><span class="style84"><span class="style79"><img src="sharon knight-drum" alt="brid's closet-sharon knight" />Sharon Knight</span></span><br />
            </p>
            <p>Like the sirens of the sea she is oft campared with, Sharon's distinctive voice captivates audiences  young and old, sweeping them away to otherworldly vistas of myth and magick. </p>
            <p>Enthralled at an early age by the indomitable spirit of the Celts and the power and melancholy of their songs, she made her first foray into music singing and accompanying herself on guitar, madola, and percussion in Celtic ensembles and as a solo act throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. </p>
            <p>Equally  fascinated by the myths and legends of the Celts, her music has found inspiration in such luminaries  as Robin Williamson and William Butler Yeates. Finding in music the perfect vehicle for exploring these visionary landscapes, she has sought to fuse these elements together through her art.  Writing in the &quot;twilight language&quot; that poets throughout the ages have used to traverse these mysteries, Sharon strives to craft songs that  journey into the the soul's innermost landscapes, where vast and wondrous realms exist, reminding us that our lives can be epic everyday. </p>
            <p>Sharon and her longtime collaborator, Winter, record and perform with some of the Bay Area's most accomplished musicians. They have been heard on over 300 radio stations, played in a wide range of venues from grand to modest, enjoyed &quot;top 10 status&quot; on MP3 and NAR charts, and have captured the attention of major labels and independent labels alike.  Their music has been featured in two independed films, &quot;Beatific Vision&quot; and  &quot;The Commune&quot; .  They are also the founding members of  the gothic/world/rock band, Pandemonaeon.</p>
            <p>Sharon's commitment to her art remains firmly rooted in the archetypal language of myth, striving to meet her audience in the deep realms of the psyche.  In so doing, she reminds us that we can all see the world through the eyes of enchantment. </p>

          What is the number one question for the tarot? LOVE!!! "How do I get it?" "How is it going?" "Is my ex ever coming back?" This class focuses solely on the Love Reading. Students will discover the cards that represent their own romantic situation and those of their significant others and explore the romantic natures of both Trumps and Pips. Whether you single or partnered, this class will have interesting and helpful things to teach you! Great for readers who read regularly for others, as well as for those who primarily read for themselves. It will also provide new readings including the "Love Prescription" reading-when you consult the Tarot to find out how to bring new love into your life or increase the affection and chemistry in a relationship you already have! </span>&nbsp;</p>
