  <p class="sidebarHeader">Hawk Messenger Workshop<br />
    <br />
    This is a powerful workshop where Hawklyn will speak about hawk as messenger. Hawklyn will speak about her process of combining falconry and spirituality, in conjunction with individual and community healing. Everyone who attends will choose their very own keepsake photo hawk card with a beautiful photo of one of four hawks that they work with that day, along with a description of the hawk’s distinctive personality trait(s). After we have become familiar with the messenger teachings, and have chosen our hawk guides, we will embark on a deep and guided shamanic meditation and become one with our chosen messenger to receive the messages that await us. We will shape shift and become one with this amazing totem. You will leave with tools and guidance that you can call on again and again. Following the workshop Hawklyn will do a meet and greet with her Red tail Hawk Lady Z.  Feel her gaze, and sense what she has to tell YOU! </p>
  <p class="sidebarHeader">Bio</p>
  <p class="sidebarHeader">Lynn Martin was born with a great love for the outdoors and an innate need and purpose to help and protect the wild kingdom. As a child she preferred the woods, fields and her own handmade forts in tall Sycamore trees over watching television or material things. She has cared for animals and birds her entire life, and after settling in her current home state, Lynn made it official and became a licensed wildlife rehabilitator by the state of New York in 2005, and a NY and federally licensed falconer in 2009. What uniquely ties all of Lynn’s efforts together is that she has also been a life-long student of spirituality and indigenous cultures. She is a licensed Reiki Master and has studied numerous other healing modalities. Lynn is well known in the Hudson valley and beyond for her unique combination of tying together spiritual practice and raptor work. Bringing together the healing of the winged ones and the two leggeds is a rare and unique teaching. </p>

    <p>Introduction to Faery Folk: More than just Tinkerbelle 
      Whenever people speak of Faeries what usually comes to mind are tiny, delicate people with Dragonfly or Butterfly wings who sprinkle glitter wherever they fly; In short, Tinkerbelle. In this introduction we will explore the varied nature of Faery Folk and the ephemeral Land of the Fae. We will also discuss where to find them, the Fae you will most commonly encounter, and how to work with them. &nbsp;</p>

  <div>The Lenormand Revolution has arrived!  Jean Setarah aka &quot;the love   witch&quot; will be teaching an introduction to the Lenormand system of   cartomancy. </div>
  <div class="sidebarHeader">The small cards, used as a divinatory tool, took   their name from Mademoiselle Lenormand who grew famous in France during   the 1800s by being the fortune teller to Napoleon.  They are a deck of   36 cards, deceptively simple, always practical and a pleasure to read. </div>
  <div class="sidebarHeader">In   this course, Jean will cover the basic meanings of the symbols of each   card, methods of card combinations, and a simple spread.  If time and   interest allows, the Grande Tableau spread and methods for employing the   Lenormand for   spell work will also be discussed.</div>
  <div class="sidebarHeader"><br />
  </div>
  <div class="sidebarHeader">All   students should have a Lenormand deck available for use during the   class. Bernadette will have decks for sale in her store before   Beltaine and at her booth during Beltaine.</div>

              <p class="sidebarHeader">SisterMonk’s original music is female-powered, djembe-driven,&amp;culturally diverse. Soulful vocals, danceable grooves &amp; poetic   lyrics have gained the band solid fan base from east to west coast.The band evokes the spirit &amp; soul of the 60s while maintaining a distinct   modern edge. They have been compared to the likes of Ani DiFranco, Rusted Root, Natalie Merchant, Mumford &amp; Sons, Dead Can Dance. SisterMonk has shared the stage with such notable acts as Zap Mama,   Michael Franti &amp; Spearhead, Anoushka Shankar, Karl Denson Trio, Mario Batali, and more.<br />
